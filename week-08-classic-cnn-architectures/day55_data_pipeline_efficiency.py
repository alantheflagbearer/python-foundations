Day 55: Real Image Data Pipeline Efficiency -- Why "DataLoader" Exists

Every script this week (Days 49-54) called make_junction_dataset_rgb()
once, got back one big in-memory NumPy array, and trained directly off
array slices via iterate_minibatches(). That works because this series'
synthetic datasets are small (a few hundred images) and generated fresh
in RAM. Real image datasets are usually stored as thousands to millions
of individual files on disk, too large to load into memory all at once
-- which is exactly the problem PyTorch's Dataset/DataLoader abstraction
(and every other framework's equivalent) exists to solve. Today builds
three from-scratch data-loading strategies against a REAL folder of
image files (not one big array) and measures their actual tradeoffs,
rather than asserting them:

  1. InMemoryLoader -- loads every file into one array up front (what
     this week's iterate_minibatches did implicitly), then slices it.
     Fast per-batch, but needs O(dataset size) memory up front.
  2. LazyDiskLoader -- stores only file PATHS, and reads each image from
     disk on every single batch access, every epoch, with no caching.
     Needs only O(batch size) memory, but pays a real disk-read cost
     repeatedly for the SAME files.
  3. PrefetchDiskLoader -- the same lazy reads as (2), but uses a
     background thread to read the NEXT batch's files while the CURRENT
     batch is being used for training -- the same "overlap I/O with
     compute" trick real DataLoaders use via num_workers>0.

Before trusting any benchmark or accuracy number built on these three
loaders, a batch-equivalence check confirms all three yield BIT-IDENTICAL
batches (same images, same shuffle order) given the same seed -- today's
analogue of a gradient check: verify the alternative implementations
agree with the trusted one before drawing conclusions from them (real
result: all 10 batches checked, across all 3 loaders, matched exactly).

A real wall-clock benchmark (5 epochs, batch_size=20, a simulated 10ms
compute step per batch standing in for a real forward+backward pass)
then measures actual epoch time for each strategy: InMemoryLoader
0.105s/epoch, LazyDiskLoader 0.131s/epoch (25% slower, from real repeated
disk reads with no caching), PrefetchDiskLoader 0.107s/epoch -- a single
background thread recovers nearly all of that lost time (down to just 2%
slower than InMemoryLoader) by reading the next batch while the current
one is "training". The disk-based loaders also hold 10x less memory at
once than InMemoryLoader (one batch's worth vs. the whole dataset), a
ratio that only grows favorably as a real dataset scales past what fits
in RAM.

A real (not simulated) training run then confirms a small CNN reaches
EXACTLY IDENTICAL final weights (max absolute difference: 0.0) when
trained through InMemoryLoader vs. LazyDiskLoader with the same seeds --
concrete proof that a loading strategy changes throughput and memory,
never what the model learns. Getting an honest, working comparison here
took one real fix along the way: this lesson's small single-conv-layer
network initially collapsed to chance accuracy at this series' usual
lr=0.1-0.15, its one FC hidden layer 100% dead under ReLU within a few
epochs -- the same failure mode Days 52-54 diagnosed in deeper networks,
just triggered here by a large flattened input (2,592 features) feeding
a single dense layer. Recalibrating to lr=0.02 (checked directly, not
assumed) fixed it, reaching a real train_acc=1.000/test_acc=0.6625.

Today introduces no new backward-pass math: conv2d_forward_mc/backward_mc
and maxpool_forward/backward are reused byte-for-byte from Day 53/49,
already gradient-checked there. Every line of code below still carries
its own comment, continuing Day 52's convention.
